## About Me

My name is Daniel Arzanipour and I've always liked technology (_the software part of it_) and have been interested in its design and creation, an opportunity had presented itself and I decided to give this passion of mine a shot

I'm always looking for new technologies to learn and considering how much effort I had to put in to understand the theory and application of so many of them in such a short time frame, now I'm always looking for new technologies, styles theories to improve my way of doing things
